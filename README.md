**Work in progress!**

# To build:
*Make sure Gulp is installed!*
  1. `cd` into repo
  2. install node dependencies with `npm install`
  3. install bower dependencies with `bower install`
  4. type `gulp build` to render less files, move bower modules, etc...
  5. `gulp server` will run the server on port 8080 (HTTP) and 3000 (WS) for now.
